Connect-Four

In this TOP project we are building a connect four game on the command line in a TDD(Test Driven Development) cycle. The goal of this project is to practice writing RSpec tests to ensure not only that the critical functions of the codebase executes as intended, but also to allow the code to be much more readable.
